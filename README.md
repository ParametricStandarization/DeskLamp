Parametric Standardized Desk Lamp

The PS Desk Lamp combines 3D-printed components with various standard raw materials, from metal tubes to wooden profiles. Each software-generated component is based on a selected dimension, or parameter. Parts therefore adapt to the material they will accompany. One can imagine printing components that fit a standard 8mm metal tube in Europe, while components produced in the U.S. might join to a half-inch wooden dowel.

As a result, the lamp represents a new paradigm in production and distribution of an everyday object. All parts are reproducible using home-scale 3D-printers, and can be created nearly anywhere. Distribution can occur on a variety of scales: as a usable product, a DIY self-build kit, or simply as digital definitions of individual components.
