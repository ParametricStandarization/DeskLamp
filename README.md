Parametric Standardized Desk Lamp

The PS Desk Lamp combines 3D-printed components with various standard raw materials, from metal tubes to wooden profiles. Each software-generated component is based on a selected dimension, or parameter. Parts therefore adapt to the material they will accompany. One can imagine printing components that fit a standard 8mm metal tube in Europe, while components produced in the U.S. might join to a half-inch wooden dowel.

As a result, the lamp represents a new paradigm in production and distribution of an everyday object. All parts are reproducible using home-scale 3D-printers, and can be created nearly anywhere. Distribution can occur on a variety of scales: as a usable product, a DIY self-build kit, or simply as digital definitions of individual components.  



## Print Guide ##
A short explanation how we have our prints and printers set up. Feel free to add print settings to the designated folder. We uploaded our own to give an indication how we print the parts.

*SUGGESTED MATERIAL:*

For the making of the lamps we use ABS as standard material. Choosen for durability, easiness to print, flexibility and availability. PLA can be used as well, but because we work with (never completely correct) DIY store objects flexibility is a slight issue.


*PRINTING TIPS:*

For the known adhesion problems when printing ABS use a heated glass plate (minimum of 70 c) with a few strokes of a glue stick (3 or 4 times in different directions). Glue stsick needs to contain PVA, we use Collal, UHU is an alternative.
The extruder is heated up between 235 and 245. We prefer 245 when prints are what larger for better inter layer adhesion.
The models are already placed in correct directions, do not alter these because the printing direction is important for the object strength.

*SLICING SETTINGS:*

*	Printing speed 60-80 mm/s for all except bridiging 10mm/s
*	Layer height 0,2 mm 
*	extruder width maximum of 4mm (important for self drawn support!)
*	5 top and 5 bottom layers so the shell is 1 mm thick. 
*	No support is needed for the designs.
	
If problems do occur, feel free to ask in the github Issues department.
